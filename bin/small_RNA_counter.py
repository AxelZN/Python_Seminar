DESCRIPTION
        Open a file containing sRNA sequences and know which ones are larger than 300pb,
        print their names and their length.

CATEGORY
        RNA

USAGE
        Open a file that contains genes and create a file with only the genes that are larger than 300 bp.
        The file must be in the same directory as this script
